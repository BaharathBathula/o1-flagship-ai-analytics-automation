# O-1 Flagship Project — AI Automation for Analytics Reporting (Production Workflow)
Overview
This flagship project designs and implements an AI automation workflow that reduces manual analytics reporting effort by automating ingestion, validation, transformation, insight generation, and delivery of reporting outputs. The system is built with production readiness in mind (reliability, monitoring, and repeatability).

Problem Statement
Many analytics teams rely on manual reporting processes that are time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale. This project provides a structured automation approach that improves speed, consistency, and operational reliability.

What This Project Demonstrates:

> Workflow automation for analytics reporting (end-to-end)

> Data validation and quality checks to prevent downstream failures

> Repeatable scheduling/orchestration patterns (production mindset)

> AI-assisted insight generation and narrative summaries

> Delivery automation (email/report publishing) with auditability

High-Level Workflow:

> Ingest data (CSV/API/DB)

> Validate schema + quality checks

> Transform and compute metrics

> Generate insights (rules + AI summarization)

> Produce output (report/dashboard-ready tables)

> Deliver (email/export) + log results

Planned Deliverables:

> Architecture diagram + system components

> Metrics computation module

> Automated reporting template (daily/weekly)

> AI-generated executive summary module

> Runbook (operations + monitoring)

> Demo dataset and reproducible pipeline
